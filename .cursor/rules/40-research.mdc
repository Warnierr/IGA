# Research Protocol

## When to Document Research

Document in `docs/research.md` when:
- Adopting external library/technique
- Evaluating competing approaches
- Referencing academic papers
- Using code from GitHub/HuggingFace

## Entry Format

```markdown
| Technique | Source | Capability | Module Mapping | Decision |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Name** | [Link](url) | What it does | Where it fits | adopt/postpone/reject |
```

## Decision Criteria

### Adopt
- Directly solves a roadmap item
- Well-maintained (recent commits, good docs)
- License compatible (MIT, Apache, BSD)
- Reasonable dependency footprint

### Postpone
- Interesting but not critical path
- Requires significant integration work
- Dependencies conflict
- "Nice to have" for future milestone

### Reject
- Doesn't fit architecture
- Unmaintained or abandoned
- License issues
- Better alternatives exist

## Research Sources

### Primary (High Signal)
- arXiv/OpenReview papers (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS)
- GitHub trending in ML/CV
- HuggingFace Spaces demos
- Official library documentation

### Secondary (Verify Claims)
- Blog posts (Medium, Dev.to)
- Stack Overflow answers
- YouTube tutorials
- Reddit discussions

## Integration Checklist

When adopting external code:

- [ ] License verified
- [ ] Documented in research.md
- [ ] Minimal example tested locally
- [ ] Dependencies added to package.json
- [ ] Import/usage documented in code comments

## Research Sessions

Before starting a major milestone:

1. **Search** for existing solutions (30 min)
2. **Evaluate** top 3 options against criteria
3. **Document** findings in research.md
4. **Decide** adopt/postpone/reject
5. **Proceed** with implementation

## Model Recommendations

Based on research:

| Task | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Plan writing | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Balance speed/quality |
| Deep research | Claude Opus 4.5 | Synthesis + consolidation |
| Code implementation | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Agent-optimized |
| Image generation | Gemini 3 Pro | Google ecosystem |
